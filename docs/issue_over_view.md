# Key Features of this API Specification:

1. **Standalone Functions**: Each function is designed to be independently implementable
2. **Clear Parameters**: All input parameters with types and descriptions
3. **Detailed Return Values**: Complete response structures with realistic data
4. **Dependencies**: Clear indication of what each function depends on
5. **Function Calls**: What other functions each one calls internally

**Major API Categories Covered:**

- **User Management & Authentication** (FR-001 to FR-004)
- **Leave Request Management** (FR-005 to FR-012)
- **Leave Balance Management** (FR-013 to FR-016)
